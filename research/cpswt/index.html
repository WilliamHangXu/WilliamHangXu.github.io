                <b>TL;DR:</b> CPSWT is a tool for distributed simulation that
                leverages a conceptual framework called HLA.

              <p>
                <b>High Level Architecture (HLA)</b> We often need to integrate
                different simulators and let them work together to simulate a
                larger system. The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Level_Architecture"
                  >High Level Architecture</a
                >
                is a solution to this problem. It is a conceptual framework that
                fosters interoperability and reuse of simulations and specifies
                what a simulation looks like. In HLA, all the simulators are
                wrapped as something we call federates. All the activities that
                happen among these federates are managed by the run time
                infrastructure, or RTI, which the federates are connected to.
                This combined simulation is called a federation. The federates
                can share data among each other. A federate can publish or
                subscribe to certain data to declare its interest in updating or
                getting updates, and the RTI is responsible for delivering the
                messages. Also, each federate might have their own logical
                clock, and they need the RTI to advance their logical time or
                synchronize them with other federates.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Cyber Physical System Wind Tunnel</b> HLA is just a set of
                rules, and we code our simulation program according to it. This
                is tedious because we need to set up the whole thing from
                scratch. For example, we need to make the simulators into
                HLA-compliant federates, and we also need to set up the
                communication between simulators and the RTI. The Cyber Physical
                System Wind Tunnel, or CPSWT, largely solves this problem,
                because it has many premade federates and HLA related
                functionalities. We use the meta programmable graphical editor
                WebGME to create a FOM sheet to specify what our federation
                looks like, and CPSWT will automatically generate almost all the
                code for us, whether Java or C++. All we need to do is to
                configure the federate to tell them what to do.

                CPSWT contains many premade federates for popular simulators,
                such as the omnet++ discrete event simulator. I have been trying
                to add a new federate based on a network simulator called ns3.
                The first step is to make a scheduler to schedule events for the
                simulator, and then we need to implement the interface between
                the RTI and the model so that the two can communicate with each
                other. Hereâ€™s a use case of the ns3 federate: suppose the sender
                wants to send a message to the receiver through a network, the
                message will get to the RTI first. The RTI will then send the
                message to the ns3 federate, which is received by the Interface.
                The interface will pass the message to the model, and the
                message will propagate through the network model and then get
                back to the Interface, who will then send the message to the
                RTI, and the RTI will send the message to the receiver. The ns3
                federate allows us to simulate activities like network attack on
                the simulation model we build.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have created several sample simulation models to demonstrate
                and test the functionality of CPSWT. Previously, these samples
                contained components that were not in libraries. This means
                whenever we make changes to certain components, the update is
                not reflected in our models, so we need to go to these models
                and make the same changes for all of them. I have updated the
                sample models and now they are using components that are in
                libraries, which means that if we make changes to certain
                components and then open a sample, there will be an option for
                us to reflect the changes by simply clicking a button. This
                makes the samples easier to maintain.
