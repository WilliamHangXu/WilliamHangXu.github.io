                In this project, a simulated vehicle drives on a straight lane,
                attempting to get from one end to another. The vehicle needs to
                stay within the lane, avoid obstacles, and collect resources.
                This is formulated as a model predictive control problem, which
                can be solved by using non-linear programming. See the

                This project, implemented in Julia, is an extension of a
                homework assignment from the Autonomous Vehicle class I took at
                Vanderbilt.

                The car drives on a straight lane, starting from the left side.
                We apply control (acceleration and angular velocity) to the car
                to change its state (location, velocity, and heading angle) to
                reach the right side of the lane. The car has to avoid obstacles
                (blue circles) and collect resources (red circles). The car does
                not have full information about the lane layout. At each time
                step, it can only see objects that are in its visible area (the
                yellow area).
              </p>
              <p>
                While the car is trying to reach the end point, there are
                certain constraints that it needs to satisfy, and there are some
                values that it wants to minimize or maximize. Thus, the
                simulation is basically solving a series of optimization
                problems. In general, the whole simulation proceeds step by
                step. At each time step, the car examines the visible objects,
                and generate a trajectory (green dots extending from the car) of
                certain length by solving the optimization problem. Then, the
                car moves to the first step of the generated trajectory for the
                next time step. This loop continues until the car reaches the
                end point.

              <p>
                For simplicity, this section only offers a conceptual overview
                of the optimization problem. For detailed mathematical
                formulation and implementation, please refer to the github
                repository.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Design variables</b> The goal of the optimization problem is
                to generate a trajectory consisting of vehicle states and
                controls. THese controls and states are the design variables
                that we can control.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Constraints</b> There are five sets of constraints that need
                to be satisfied:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Physics constraints. The state transition must obey physics
                  laws.
                </li>
                <li>Lane constraints. The vehicle must not leave the lane.</li>
                <li>
                  Obstacle constraints. The vehicle must not collide with
                  obstacles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Velocity constraints. The vehicle must maintain a speed higher
                  than a minimum value.
                </li>
                <li>Heading constraints. The vehicle must not go backwards.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                <b>Objective function</b> The objective function, whose value we
                want to minimize, is the sum of costs at each trajectory step.
                At each step, the cost consists of three components:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The negative of the velocity, because we would like the
                  vehicle to drive fast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The square of controls (acceleration and angular velocity),
                  because we want the vehicle to drive smoothly and hence avoid
                  radical controls.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Amount of resources collected (actually more complicated than
                  this), because we want the vehicle to collect as much resource
                  as possible.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Thus, the overall optimization problem is \[ argmin_{z} \; f(z)
                \\ s.t. \text{ all constraints are met} \\ f(z) = \sum_{i=1}^{l}
                (-av_i-bR_i+c\alpha^2+d\omega_i^2) \] where: \( z \) is the
                trajectory, \( l \) is the trajectory length, \( v \) is the
                velocity, \( R \) is the resources collected, \( \alpha \) is
                the acceleration, \( \omega \) is the angular velocity, \(
                a,b,c,d \) are non-negative numbers that can adjust the relative
                importance of these components.
